# "Sentence structure"

# Noun - kind of like variables or data

# Verb - method or function

#joe.forward(100) # This is a command or action

# Built-in functions are purple in IDLE

# Variable names start with a letter, lowercase
x
y
z

w = 17 # w is the width
width = 17

# Prefer descriptive variable names over 1-letter names
volume
length
width

# Variable can have a number in it
x2
x1
y2
y1

# Multiple words are separated by _

# This is the side length, it will be shorter than the side width
side_length
number_of_sides

# NOT THIS:
# sideLength
# numberOfSides
# Volume

x = 7 * math.sqrt(14 - 3 / math.sqrt(17 + 8)) / math.sin(19)


# Variables/values in Python have "types"

# Four-ish that we use frequently

# Integer
# "regular number": 7, 123, 99000000, -800

# Float
# "decimal point number": 1.5, -0.425, 75.8

# Boolean
# True and False

# String
word = "hello"

# If you need " inside a string, then use ' on the outsides
# If you need ' inside a string, then use " on the outsides
# If you need both " and ' inside a string, then escape (\) one or the other
